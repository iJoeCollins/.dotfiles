# Sample gitconfig
# Credit - https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/blob/master/git/gitconfig.symlink.example
# This is a sample gitconfig. Usually we keep a lot of sensitive information
# here (things like authentication tokens, email addresses, and so on), so this
# file is ignored in this project's .gitignore.
#
# To set this up, rename this file to `gitconfig.symlink` and you'll be able to
# install this to the correct location by running the project's 'install_dotfiles'
# script.
